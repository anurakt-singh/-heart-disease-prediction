# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient medical data.

## Files Included
- `heart_prediction_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing full EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset used for the project.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
